"Select Scan Mode."

In this mode, draw a rectangle with the left mouse button.  When you
confirm with the middle mouse button, all meshes completely outside the
drawn rectangle will be hidden (not drawn).  This routine uses bounding
boxes, so it grabs all meshes within the box, whether they are currently
visible or not.  This is not as aggressive as selectVisScan.
