"Select Visible Scans Mode."

In this mode, draw a rectangle with the left mouse button.  When you
confirm with the middle mouse button, all meshes that do not have any pixels
visible in the rectangle will be hidden (not drawn).  This routine reads
the pixel values.  It is more aggressive than selectScan, because it will
turn off any meshes that are backfacing or occluded, even if they fall
within the rectangle.
