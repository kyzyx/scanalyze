"Move the mesh mode."

In this mode, your mouse actions in the main window will move the
currently selected mesh.  Drag the left mouse button to rotate
the mesh, middle mouse button to translate, and both together to
move the mesh closer/farther from you.  Changes to the mesh
position affect the mesh transform, which is saved if you write
the .xf file when exiting.
