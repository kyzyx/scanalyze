Align images to mesh, by clicking corresponding points.

When the image alignment tool pops up, make sure you choose
the appropriate camera type and desired zoom.  Then open the
image.  Select points on the image by middle-clicking, and then
hit space to confirm.  Then, in XYZ Coord mode in the scanalyze
window, click on the corresponding point on the mesh.  You need
at least 6 (?) points to have any hope of aligning the image
to the mesh.
