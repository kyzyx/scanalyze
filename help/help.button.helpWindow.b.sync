This button can be used to sync with the CVS repository.

If you run scanalyze from your own directory, don't worry
about it since you will check in files eventually anyway.

If you run the generic version of scanalyze, this can be

you have written.

It just does a
cvs add SCANALYZE_DIR/help/*
cvs update SCANALYZE_DIR/help
cvs commit SCANALYZE_DIR/help
