"Move the light mode."

In this mode, you move the (directional) light source.  Click or drag
the left mouse button around the screen.  When the mouse is in the center
of the window, you get the default (straight-on) lighting.  When the mouse
is near the top right, the light also appears to be coming from above and
to the right.
