1.0 Compilation Instructions
----------------------------

For all systems you will need to have OpenGL as well as GLU installed on 
your computer.

1.1 Linux and IRIX
------------------
In the scanalyze source code directory, run "make".  For Linux, you can 
choose between the debug and optimized version.  Run "make opt" to compile 
the optimized version, and "make debug" for the debug version.  The default 
version is the debug version.  Similarly for IRIX, you can compile 32bit 
and 64 bit debug and optimized versions.  Run "make opt32" or "make opt64 "
for optimized versions, and "make debug32" or "make debug64" for debug 
versions.

When compiling for IRIX, you will need to modify the Makedefs.IRIX file to 
include the correct path to your Tcl/Tk library files.  You may also need 
to do this for Linux if your version of Tcl/Tk is not contained in the 
include and library paths in the Makedefs.Linux file.

On IRIX systems, you have the option of building scanalyze with
fancy terminal support.  There is a line in the file Makedefs.IRIX
which can be uncommented to enable this functionality, assuming
that the necessary libraries are installed (tclrl, GNU ReadLine, termcap).

1.2 Windows
-----------
To compile scanalyze you will need two more packages: SGI's IFL (image 
format library) and Tcl/Tk version 8.0p2 (later versions are not 
compatible yet). You also need Gnu Make; we use the version that comes 
with Cygwin.  All three are available on the web page. 
To build it you should: 

-install Tck/Tk 
-install IFL 
-have installed MS VC++ 6.0 
-install Cygwin 
-unpack scanalyze 
-(in the cygwin shell) cd to the scanalyze directory and type make.  Type 
 make opt32 for the optimized version and make debug32 for the debug 
 version.  The default version is the debug version.


2.0 Run Instructions
--------------------

2.1 Linux and IRIX
------------------
-install Tcl/Tk 
-set environment variable SCANALYZE_DIR to the directory where you  
 unpacked scanalyze 
-run scanalyze 
-you may need to set the TCL_LIBRARY and TK_LIBRARY environment variables 
 to the directory where init.tcl, etc... reside if Tcl/Tk is not able to 
 find these files itself. 

2.2 Windows
-----------
To run scanalyze you will need two more packages: SGI's IFL (image format 
library) and Tcl/Tk version 8.0p2 (later versions are not compatible yet). 
Both are available on the web page.

-install Tck/Tk 
-install IFL 
-unpack scanalyze 
-set environment variable SCANALYZE_DIR to the directory where you 
 unpacked scanalyze 
-run scanalyze 

2.3 Optional "QSlim" Mesh Decimation
------------------------------------
Scanalyze features a couple of different types of mesh decimation.
The "plycrunch" decimation algorithm is built into scanalyze, whereas
the "qslim" decimation algorithm can be invoked as an external program.
To support the qslim functionality, you'll need to have Michael
Garland's "qslim" program installed on your system, and visible in
your PATH when you run scanalyze.  Precompiled QSlim binaries for
Windows, Linux, and IRIX are available for download at this URL:

   http://graphics.cs.uiuc.edu/~garland/software/qslim.html

3.0 Windows Icon Instructions
-----------------------------

To associate the scanalyze bunny icon with a ply file in Windows, perform 
the following steps:

- Right click on the ply file and then choose properties.  Next click on 
on the "Change" button and select the scanalyze executable.  This will 
cause scanalyze to load when a ply file is double clicked.

- To associate the provided icon with scanalyze, click on Tools->Folder Options 
in a Windows directory window.  Then click on File Types and find the PLY 
file listing.  Click on the Advanced button, and then on the Change Icon 
button to select which icon to use for scanalyze.
